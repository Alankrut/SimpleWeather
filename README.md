# SimpleWeather
A Simple Weather Application for Android

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is so I can learn to utilize Google's Snapshot API in a real world application. This is a simple weather application which will use the Snapshot API to get the weather information at the user's current location. Initially I plan to use this project to get familiar working with the Snapshot API, however once this is complete, I may expand upon this project with extra functionality.
